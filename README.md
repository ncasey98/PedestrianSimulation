Final Year Project

Simulation and Visualisation of Pedestrian Movement in Crowded Spaces

The university's ever-expanding student population explodes onto the corridors every hour at the same time, and must vie for space as they beat a path to the next lecture. This project will use a simulation system such as AnyLogic to simulate and visualise these movements. This system will allow us to experiment with ideas such as traffic lanes, variable lecture times, lecture theatre location, etc.. It may involve the use of specialised libraries for visualisation of the simulation outputs. Using models of stress response, such as General Adaptation Syndrom (GAS), advanced work on this topic could involve incorporating models of stress response in agents to study the impact on crows of stressful events such as fires.
